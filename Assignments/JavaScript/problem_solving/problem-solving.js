// A computer application needs to be able to identify if a written paragraph is written in First, Second, or Third Person

1. Using comments, write out 1 strategy that could be used to solve the problem.

// One way i would solve this problem is too check the words that are used in the sentences, 
// check for such words for first person, second person and third person

2. Using comments, create pseudocode (an informal but readable description of code that uses regular language to outline a solution) to apply one of the strategies to solve the problem.

//go through ever word in the sentences to check if you see key words
// check for words like "I/we" and log those as First person sentences
// check for words like "you" and log those as Second person
// check for words like "he/she/it/they" and log those as Third person
// keep a count of what words you find and put them in their categories
// add up the count, which ever one has the most than thats what should show up in the console.

3. Using comments, write a short paragraph that answers: What is the hardest part of problem-solving?

//The hardest part about problem solving is breaking it down to simply it. Some problems are so big and we can get overwhelmed with how much stuff we actually need to do, instead we should break it down into the smallest pieces and solve that one until it all comes together, thats easier said than done //
